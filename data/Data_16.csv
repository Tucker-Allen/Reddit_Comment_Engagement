But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

309,2018-02-20 03:51:21.741370,The Lion of the Union: The Pelvic Wound of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain -,2018-02-19 22:29:51,drazion,history,694,694,0.93,self.history,False,False,0,False,all_ads,all_ads,/r/history/comments/7yqteq/the_lion_of_the_union_the_pelvic_wound_of_joshua/,,,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Following the battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Chamberlain suffered from “neurasthenia” or Civil War illness syndrome (the modem day equivalent of posttraumatic stress disorder). In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Here are a few of the key points that we are ready to announce:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Finalizing our Roadmap will be done during these meetings and we hope to provide you guys with an awesome document that outlines our plans &amp; strategies.</p></li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>If you can&#39;t tell that I&#39;m excited, wait until you see what the team has been up to!
I&#39;ll be around for a while to answer your questions, and as always, come find me on <a href=""http://chat.nano.org/"">chat</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/aramsdale"">Twitter</a> - and keep that feedback coming!</p>

<p>As a final note, I am a new Team Member but I wanted to take a moment to address the CryptoKitty in the room.  BitGrail.  I want you to know we are actively working with law enforcement on addressing the BitGrail insolvency and the team will provide an update as soon as it is possible.</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

<p>One year ago, at a gas station, I had finished getting gasoline and pulled out into the (long) line of cars waiting to exit the station and enter traffic. Every 30 seconds or so, someone would pull out and the line would move forward, as lines do.</p>

<p>Well, the person immediately ahead of me wanted to exit the line. He put his Jeep Cherokee into reverse, and backed directly into my car. My car was stationary. My foot was on the brake. He just...backed into me. (Accident occurred in New York State, in Monroe County).</p>

<p>He called the police. The police would not let us speak to each other because he was angry/belligerent, and so they kept us separated presumably so he wouldn&#39;t lash out at me. I gave my statement, he gave his. Our statements matched. &quot;Jeep Cherokee backed into stationary sedan in gas station parking lot.&quot;</p>

<p>There WAS damage to both vehicles. However, a few months prior, my car had been hit hard my a UHAUL (I live in the city with city parking, so the UHAUL hit my parked vehicle, and his insurance had to cover the damage to my car.) My car was scheduled to go in for repairs anyway. So, I didn&#39;t pursue this guy for any damages. I thought to myself, &quot;It&#39;s his lucky day that my bumper was already fucked up from a different accident.&quot; I genuinely thought I was being kind!</p>

<p>Both his insurance company and mine found me to be 0% at fault, and him to be 100% at fault, because in NYS, the person backing up has all liability if he hits something in the process. He failed in his duty to check if another car was behind him. (Which, we were in a line...duh, I was behind him.)</p>

<p>The literal DAY the insurance returned with the decision in my favor, he filed a law suit against me for 100% of the damages to his car. It amounts to 1200 US dollars. I cannot even fathom that this is happening. I was served with the notice two days ago. </p>

<p>Being female, and a &quot;good girl&quot; who doesn&#39;t tangle with the law ever, my first reaction was cry. My second reaction was blind fury. My third reaction was call my insurance and get them to indemnify me and represent me in court.</p>

<p>My question is...why is he doing this? This seems like an unwinnable case for him so now I am paranoid he knows something I do not know? Because otherwise this seems frivolous and dumb. It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something else I don&#39;t know about, and he could miraculously win, and I would owe him $1200.</p>

<p>So Reddit...is there anything I do not know? Or is this guy just really dumb?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

A middle aged lady approaches me asking if I can help her get something off a top shelf.  I am 6&#39;4&quot; and get asked this a lot no matter where I go.  It&#39;s no big deal.  I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

<p>Cue her flipping me off as she walks away.</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve been hard at work and listening to all of your feedback &amp; suggestions and I know I for one am extremely excited for what the future has in store for all of us! Here’s what I’ve been authorized to update you guys with today:</p>

<h2>Mobile Wallets</h2>

<hr/>

</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Have I lost you yet? No? Well good, because what I might be even more excited for is that the team is headed to Los Angeles this week to coordinate our efforts and strategies as we move in the coming months!</p>

<p>Here are a few of the key points that we are ready to announce:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Finalizing our Roadmap will be done during these meetings and we hope to provide you guys with an awesome document that outlines our plans &amp; strategies.</p></li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>If you can&#39;t tell that I&#39;m excited, wait until you see what the team has been up to!
I&#39;ll be around for a while to answer your questions, and as always, come find me on <a href=""http://chat.nano.org/"">chat</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/aramsdale"">Twitter</a> - and keep that feedback coming!</p>

<p>As a final note, I am a new Team Member but I wanted to take a moment to address the CryptoKitty in the room.  BitGrail.  I want you to know we are actively working with law enforcement on addressing the BitGrail insolvency and the team will provide an update as soon as it is possible.</p>

Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

<p>One year ago, at a gas station, I had finished getting gasoline and pulled out into the (long) line of cars waiting to exit the station and enter traffic. Every 30 seconds or so, someone would pull out and the line would move forward, as lines do.</p>

<p>Well, the person immediately ahead of me wanted to exit the line. He put his Jeep Cherokee into reverse, and backed directly into my car. My car was stationary. My foot was on the brake. He just...backed into me. (Accident occurred in New York State, in Monroe County).</p>

<p>He called the police. The police would not let us speak to each other because he was angry/belligerent, and so they kept us separated presumably so he wouldn&#39;t lash out at me. I gave my statement, he gave his. Our statements matched. &quot;Jeep Cherokee backed into stationary sedan in gas station parking lot.&quot;</p>

<p>There WAS damage to both vehicles. However, a few months prior, my car had been hit hard my a UHAUL (I live in the city with city parking, so the UHAUL hit my parked vehicle, and his insurance had to cover the damage to my car.) My car was scheduled to go in for repairs anyway. So, I didn&#39;t pursue this guy for any damages. I thought to myself, &quot;It&#39;s his lucky day that my bumper was already fucked up from a different accident.&quot; I genuinely thought I was being kind!</p>

<p>Both his insurance company and mine found me to be 0% at fault, and him to be 100% at fault, because in NYS, the person backing up has all liability if he hits something in the process. He failed in his duty to check if another car was behind him. (Which, we were in a line...duh, I was behind him.)</p>

<p>The literal DAY the insurance returned with the decision in my favor, he filed a law suit against me for 100% of the damages to his car. It amounts to 1200 US dollars. I cannot even fathom that this is happening. I was served with the notice two days ago. </p>

<p>Being female, and a &quot;good girl&quot; who doesn&#39;t tangle with the law ever, my first reaction was cry. My second reaction was blind fury. My third reaction was call my insurance and get them to indemnify me and represent me in court.</p>

<p>My question is...why is he doing this? This seems like an unwinnable case for him so now I am paranoid he knows something I do not know? Because otherwise this seems frivolous and dumb. It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something else I don&#39;t know about, and he could miraculously win, and I would owe him $1200.</p>

<p>So Reddit...is there anything I do not know? Or is this guy just really dumb?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

1300,2018-02-20 04:04:50.749120,The Lion of the Union: The Pelvic Wound of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain -,2018-02-19 22:29:51,drazion,history,748,748,0.93,self.history,False,False,0,False,all_ads,all_ads,/r/history/comments/7yqteq/the_lion_of_the_union_the_pelvic_wound_of_joshua/,,,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Following the battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Chamberlain suffered from “neurasthenia” or Civil War illness syndrome (the modem day equivalent of posttraumatic stress disorder). In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

<p>One year ago, at a gas station, I had finished getting gasoline and pulled out into the (long) line of cars waiting to exit the station and enter traffic. Every 30 seconds or so, someone would pull out and the line would move forward, as lines do.</p>

<p>Well, the person immediately ahead of me wanted to exit the line. He put his Jeep Cherokee into reverse, and backed directly into my car. My car was stationary. My foot was on the brake. He just...backed into me. (Accident occurred in New York State, in Monroe County).</p>

<p>He called the police. The police would not let us speak to each other because he was angry/belligerent, and so they kept us separated presumably so he wouldn&#39;t lash out at me. I gave my statement, he gave his. Our statements matched. &quot;Jeep Cherokee backed into stationary sedan in gas station parking lot.&quot;</p>

<p>There WAS damage to both vehicles. However, a few months prior, my car had been hit hard my a UHAUL (I live in the city with city parking, so the UHAUL hit my parked vehicle, and his insurance had to cover the damage to my car.) My car was scheduled to go in for repairs anyway. So, I didn&#39;t pursue this guy for any damages. I thought to myself, &quot;It&#39;s his lucky day that my bumper was already fucked up from a different accident.&quot; I genuinely thought I was being kind!</p>

<p>Both his insurance company and mine found me to be 0% at fault, and him to be 100% at fault, because in NYS, the person backing up has all liability if he hits something in the process. He failed in his duty to check if another car was behind him. (Which, we were in a line...duh, I was behind him.)</p>

<p>The literal DAY the insurance returned with the decision in my favor, he filed a law suit against me for 100% of the damages to his car. It amounts to 1200 US dollars. I cannot even fathom that this is happening. I was served with the notice two days ago. </p>

<p>Being female, and a &quot;good girl&quot; who doesn&#39;t tangle with the law ever, my first reaction was cry. My second reaction was blind fury. My third reaction was call my insurance and get them to indemnify me and represent me in court.</p>

<p>My question is...why is he doing this? This seems like an unwinnable case for him so now I am paranoid he knows something I do not know? Because otherwise this seems frivolous and dumb. It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something else I don&#39;t know about, and he could miraculously win, and I would owe him $1200.</p>

<p>So Reddit...is there anything I do not know? Or is this guy just really dumb?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Have I lost you yet? No? Well good, because what I might be even more excited for is that the team is headed to Los Angeles this week to coordinate our efforts and strategies as we move in the coming months!</p>

<p>Here are a few of the key points that we are ready to announce:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Finalizing our Roadmap will be done during these meetings and we hope to provide you guys with an awesome document that outlines our plans &amp; strategies.</p></li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>If you can&#39;t tell that I&#39;m excited, wait until you see what the team has been up to!
I&#39;ll be around for a while to answer your questions, and as always, come find me on <a href=""http://chat.nano.org/"">chat</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/aramsdale"">Twitter</a> - and keep that feedback coming!</p>

<p>As a final note, I am a new Team Member but I wanted to take a moment to address the CryptoKitty in the room.  BitGrail.  I want you to know we are actively working with law enforcement on addressing the BitGrail insolvency and the team will provide an update as soon as it is possible.</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

<p>Cue her flipping me off as she walks away.</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

<p>The wife now even crazier insists on going in. &quot;I have been his wife for 20 years, I know every inch of him. I definitely can tell him apart.&quot; so the firemen finally decide to let her in. </p>

<p>She goes to the first bag, opens its, reaches with her hand all the way down to his private area... &quot;hmmm, that&#39;s not him&quot;. She then goes to the next bag repeats the same thing, &quot;hmmmmm, that&#39;s not him either&quot;.  </p>

<p>She opens the third bag, again reaches all the way down to the guys privates. but this time there is a long pause. &quot;mmmmm This guy is not even from this building&quot; </p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single.

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

With the film coming out March 2nd, I will answer questions that you may have about these characters and the process, without giving away too much of course. There are some wonderful twists and turns in the story that you won’t see coming, and we should preserve those for the moviegoers to experience.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

With the film coming out March 2nd, I will answer questions that you may have about these characters and the process, without giving away too much of course. There are some wonderful twists and turns in the story that you won’t see coming, and we should preserve those for the moviegoers to experience.</p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>I should be living comfortably, with little to no debt. Instead, I have $40,000 in outstanding student loans and another $40,000 in high interest credit. My monthly bills are at or exceeding my monthly income. I feel a bit like giving up and going to live off the land and off the grid. I&#39;m not really sure why i&#39;m putting all this info online, or what I hope to gain from it, I think it just feels good to get it out there. </p>

<p>The big reason it feels good to vent is because I recently got engaged to the love of my life - and she doesn&#39;t know about the credit debt. We&#39;re supposed to get married in the next year, and sooner or later I&#39;m going to have to tell her the truth. I admit, my plan was to get the debt out of the way so she would never have to know. Unfortunately that&#39;s no longer a reality. </p>

<p>So, how did I rack up all this debt? Well..</p>

<p>Student Loans - $40k </p>

<p>Went to an expensive college. Made no payments or minimum payments as long as I could. Student loan payments went from $60/month to $405/month in 12 months. </p>

<p>Various CCs: $40k</p>

<p>Ugh, where do I start. Vacations, furniture, musical instruments, food, outings with friends, gambling (not a lot but here and there I would drop some on gambling, maybe $3k total over 2-3 years), car repairs, clothes, dates, etc... I was just living way beyond my means for a long time, and only making minimum payments. </p>

<p>Anyway here is my current monthly bills:</p>

<p>Rent - $1250 
Car Lease - $275
Internet - $70
Electricity - $70
Student Loans - $405
Loan #1 - $257 (11,800) 
CC #1 minimum - $125 (5,950) 
CC #2 minimum - $125 (5,900)
CC #3 minimum - $100 (5,000)
CC #4 minimum - $100 (5,750)<br/>
CC #5 minimum - $100 (6,000) </p>

<p>Looking at around $3,000 in minimum payment bills, not counting food or gas or any entertainment or anything. Oh this also doesn&#39;t include a $200 401k loan repayment I&#39;m making to account for an expensive international vacation I took. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only making around $1,700 take home every 2 weeks because most of my $125k/year comes in quarterly bonuses. </p>

<p>I have $0 savings. I have about $500 in my checking at any given time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to do besides continuing to grind. This weekend I cut up all my credit cards and have committed to living cheap. I don&#39;t know how to tell my Fiance the truth and she&#39;s obviously going to notice the change in lifestyle. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any excuses other than being young, dumb, and willing to blow money at a ridiculous rate. It&#39;s all my fault and I want to account for it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll just leave the country and live on the beaches in Thailand. </p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

I have been working full-time as a Network Technician for my local school Board of Education since the end of June. I make roughly $36k a year, so <strong>$2,182</strong> is deposited into my bank account once per month. I have no debt of any kind and am living at home where my only expenses are gas for my truck and my credit card. </p>

<p>In January, I spoke with the <strong>VALIC</strong> representative at my school board&#39;s office and he helped me set up a <strong>457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan</strong>. I decided to deposit $500 a month into the account(s?), starting February payday. <em>No money has been deposited yet.</em></p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/dOSCD"">https://imgur.com/a/dOSCD</a></p>

<p>Honestly, I just want to know if that&#39;s a good move or if I should cancel those accounts and open something else somewhere else and how much I should invest.</p>

<p>I will be living at home until at least June. so I can probably save another $5-10k.  </p>

<p><strong>More Info:</strong></p>

<p>I originally planned on staying at this job for a year and then moving on to something bigger and better. However, I may stay another year if that matters. Not sure yet. I&#39;d like to find a better paying, more career advancing job somewhere that isn&#39;t my hometown.</p>

<p>Other random financial question:</p>

<p>I was considering buying a new (used) Honda Civic for around $10k because my current vehicle (early 2000&#39;s F-150) only gets roughly 11 MPG. I spend around $200 a month on gas and in the past few months there have been several issues, such a leak, new tires, etc. However, I did some rough calculations and it seems that continuing to drive my truck would be cheaper than having a car payment + insurance (which I would have to start paying for since it&#39;d be in my name) even with the substantial gas savings. If anyone has thoughts on that, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you to anyone who can help!</p>

<p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Wow, I did not expect such a large response to this post! Thank you to everyone who commented and helped me, I definitely appreciate it.</p>

<p>Based on what I&#39;ve learned today, I will be <strong>closing my VALIC accounts</strong> (my employer does not offer matches btw) and <strong>opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard</strong> (current front runner though I will be doing some more research just to be sure). I will deposit several thousand into the 2017 Roth IRA before it closes in April. Then I will be slowly fill out the 2018 Roth IRA over the next year. </p>

<p>I will also be <strong>opening a new online savings account with Ally</strong> and depositing most of my remaining cash into that instead of my Credit Union checking account where it all sits at the moment. I will leave $1k or so in checking. </p>

<p>I will be <strong>keeping my truck for now</strong>. It&#39;s still pretty reliable and the gas costs aren&#39;t as bad as I thought. I will reassess the car situation later on when I am better financially situated or when my truck dies. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also gotten great career advice! <a href=""/r/personalfinance"">/r/personalfinance</a> has it all. Thank you all again for the help and all the advice.</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

A middle aged lady approaches me asking if I can help her get something off a top shelf.  I am 6&#39;4&quot; and get asked this a lot no matter where I go.  It&#39;s no big deal.  I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

<p>Cue her flipping me off as she walks away.</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

With the film coming out March 2nd, I will answer questions that you may have about these characters and the process, without giving away too much of course. There are some wonderful twists and turns in the story that you won’t see coming, and we should preserve those for the moviegoers to experience.</p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

I appreciate all the love and support y&#39;all give and I&#39;ll miss doing this for the time I&#39;m gone.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

With the film coming out March 2nd, I will answer questions that you may have about these characters and the process, without giving away too much of course. There are some wonderful twists and turns in the story that you won’t see coming, and we should preserve those for the moviegoers to experience.</p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

<p>Cue her flipping me off as she walks away.</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

With budget builds, it&#39;s super common to get 8GB memory, especially in a 1x8 config, thinking that you&#39;ll upgrade to 16GB later. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if you plan to use the integrated graphics, your performance will drop <a href=""https://youtu.be/jm9baBI9LGg?t=576"">by as much as 25%</a> by using single-channel memory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say it again - get a motherboard with 4 slots. That way you can protect the 16GB memory path and go cheap on the 8GB of memory right now by getting 2x4GB. Additionally, unless you&#39;re going to be using an ITX board, you should be able to find a board with 4 memory slots for very little more money. </p>

<p>This goes for Intel units too - if you&#39;re planning on using the integrated graphics, you REALLY should do dual-channel memory. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

With budget builds, it&#39;s super common to get 8GB memory, especially in a 1x8 config, thinking that you&#39;ll upgrade to 16GB later. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if you plan to use the integrated graphics, your performance will drop <a href=""https://youtu.be/jm9baBI9LGg?t=576"">by as much as 25%</a> by using single-channel memory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say it again - get a motherboard with 4 slots. That way you can protect the 16GB memory path and go cheap on the 8GB of memory right now by getting 2x4GB. Additionally, unless you&#39;re going to be using an ITX board, you should be able to find a board with 4 memory slots for very little more money. </p>

<p>This goes for Intel units too - if you&#39;re planning on using the integrated graphics, you REALLY should do dual-channel memory. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

6759,2018-02-20 05:19:04.894843,The Lion of the Union: The Pelvic Wound of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain -,2018-02-19 22:29:51,drazion,history,1039,1039,0.92,self.history,False,False,0,False,all_ads,all_ads,/r/history/comments/7yqteq/the_lion_of_the_union_the_pelvic_wound_of_joshua/,,,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Following the battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Chamberlain suffered from “neurasthenia” or Civil War illness syndrome (the modem day equivalent of posttraumatic stress disorder). In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

With budget builds, it&#39;s super common to get 8GB memory, especially in a 1x8 config, thinking that you&#39;ll upgrade to 16GB later. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if you plan to use the integrated graphics, your performance will drop <a href=""https://youtu.be/jm9baBI9LGg?t=576"">by as much as 25%</a> by using single-channel memory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say it again - get a motherboard with 4 slots. That way you can protect the 16GB memory path and go cheap on the 8GB of memory right now by getting 2x4GB. Additionally, unless you&#39;re going to be using an ITX board, you should be able to find a board with 4 memory slots for very little more money. </p>

<p>This goes for Intel units too - if you&#39;re planning on using the integrated graphics, you REALLY should do dual-channel memory. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

A middle aged lady approaches me asking if I can help her get something off a top shelf.  I am 6&#39;4&quot; and get asked this a lot no matter where I go.  It&#39;s no big deal.  I say sure and follow her further down the aisle.  She points to a stack of tile on the very top shelf.  I tell her that there is no possible way for me to get that and the store would need to get one of those lifter things for her.  She thanks me and I go on my way.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I am back in the aisle I was previously in loading wood laminate into my cart and I hear a loud &quot;Excuse me!&quot; from behind me.  Guess who found me again.</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Are you going to help me or not?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, I have my own stuff to load.  Find an employee to help you.  They are walking around or you can go to the front desk.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;Why should I find someone else when you are already helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s at this point I realize she thinks I&#39;m an employee.</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Mam, do you think I&#39;m an employee?  I don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Her - &quot;If you don&#39;t work here than why were you helping me?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because you asked and I don&#39;t mind helping.  Look at me.  I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and cargo shorts.  All the employees are wearing an orange smock and pants.&quot;</p>

<p>Her as she is walking away- &quot;You shouldn&#39;t offer to help me if you don&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

<p>Me calling out to her - &quot;I didn&#39;t offer.  You asked.&quot;</p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Notable Box Office Stories:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

With budget builds, it&#39;s super common to get 8GB memory, especially in a 1x8 config, thinking that you&#39;ll upgrade to 16GB later. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if you plan to use the integrated graphics, your performance will drop <a href=""https://youtu.be/jm9baBI9LGg?t=576"">by as much as 25%</a> by using single-channel memory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say it again - get a motherboard with 4 slots. That way you can protect the 16GB memory path and go cheap on the 8GB of memory right now by getting 2x4GB. Additionally, unless you&#39;re going to be using an ITX board, you should be able to find a board with 4 memory slots for very little more money. </p>

<p>This goes for Intel units too - if you&#39;re planning on using the integrated graphics, you REALLY should do dual-channel memory. </p>

But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they&#39;re being really harsh.</p>

<p>There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)</p>

<p>That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn&#39;t committed suicide was because of her family and kids.</p>

<p>So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she&#39;s still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.</p>

<p>Just because someone is famous, or just because you&#39;ve never met them, doesn&#39;t make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It&#39;s still bullying.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting because people <em>reeaally</em> like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I&#39;m sick of it. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I&#39;d love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I&#39;m happy this started a good discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand that it&#39;s Fergie&#39;s job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at &#39;em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don&#39;t want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.</p></li>
<li><p>Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, &quot;Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s my reply I made to one of those commenters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. </p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a reason the phrase &quot;money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, while the &quot;landscape&quot; is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, let&#39;s not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.</p>

I was answering for 2 solid days and don&#39;t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got &quot;sick&quot; at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable &quot;how big is your dick?&quot; questions. Lets have fun. </p>

<p>Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.</p>

<p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7"">https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7</a> Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn&#39;t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair&#39;s ass off.</p>

<p>Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn&#39;t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn&#39;t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading <a href=""/r/raisedbynarcissists"">/r/raisedbynarcissists</a> and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn&#39;t in me and I wasn&#39;t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb&#39;s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I&#39;m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I&#39;m stoned.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn&#39;t big, in fact it&#39;s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it&#39;s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can&#39;t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it&#39;s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg</a> and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg"">https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg</a> The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don&#39;t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don&#39;t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don&#39;t have good ideas. I know I can&#39;t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they&#39;re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don&#39;t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.</p>

<p>Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn&#39;t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)</p>

<p>I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I&#39;d be 300 by the time I could afford one. <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A"">http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A</a></p>

We worked for a chain of English-language schools in Japan, and, if you&#39;re a sub, you&#39;re likely to be dispatched in many different directions, to various schools.</p>

<p>One day, Alex was riding the train, when he received an international call from his family. The call lasted only a moment, but he didn&#39;t realize there was a student on the same train who recognized him, and was offended by the conversation. It&#39;s not illegal to talk on your phones while on trains, but it&#39;s considered bad form and a faux pas. Anyway, the student complained to school staff (without saying anything to Alex himself), and word eventually made its way back to Personnel at HQ.</p>

<p>Now, the personnel coordinator at the time was a dick, and he decided to flex his managerial muscles. Rather than sending a simple email asking Alex to refrain from using the phone, he called Alex in on his day off, talked to him for a great deal longer than was necessary, and made Alex write two statements-- one, a letter to the (unknown) student apologizing for the incident, and a promise that would go into his personnel file saying he&#39;d never answer his phone on the train again. </p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and Alex, working as a substitute teacher, takes the train to his base school, where he&#39;d be stationed in case of emergencies. The train arrives, and he steps aboard-- but then gets a call. Caller ID shows it&#39;s personnel, and the only reason they&#39;d call at this time is if an emergency arose, and he needs to get to another school ASAP. </p>

<p>Alex ignores the call, and enjoys the 40-minute train ride to his base school (while on the clock) with a nap. When he gets off the train, he calls back personnel, who&#39;s livid and demands to know why he wasn&#39;t answering his phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mr. Coordinator, you told me to <em>never</em> answer my phone on the train, and I would <em>never</em> think of contradicting you. You made me promise, after all,&quot; Alex says.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an angry silence and a gnashing of teeth on the other end of the call, with the coordinator probably holding back an angry tirade. &quot;Just get on the damn train and get back here; we need you at [another school location],&quot; he says, and hangs up.  (This was 40 minutes back the way Alex came from, plus a good 20 minutes further)</p>

<p>Alex shrugged, and grabbed the next returning train, where I like to imagine he enjoyed another good nap (while still on the company clock).</p>

<p>&quot;Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.&quot;</p>

Wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. I decided to let my 9 year old watch the original Dukes of Hazzard tv show lastnight. It was genuine, as he has a couple die cast General Lee&#39;s and he seemed real interested in watching it. Adult me thought &quot; Heck yeah, I&#39;m totally winning as a Dad right now&quot;. So, Episode One, only a few minutes in Boss Hog and Roscoe are talking, and the word Prostitution comes up, thankfully it&#39;s subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. In that instant I saw the look of curious cross his face and I immediately ,in my mind was saying &quot;Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit&quot; as I was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. Then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says &quot;Dad, what&#39;s prostitution?&quot; To which I responded &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a form of business that some people choose to do&quot;....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. Son looks at mother and says &quot;Mom, I think when I get older I want to get into prostitution&quot; My face flushed red and I could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. Now, if I am to correct this, I will need to explain A:Sex and B:Sex for money to my son. The only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Son watched Dukes Of Hazzard, learned the term Prostitution, I explained it was a type of business. He now wants to get into prostitution when he is older. Wife might murder me.</p>

In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign</p>

<p>Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain&#39;s brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive&#39;s Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: &quot;I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. </p>

<p>While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that &quot;interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball&#39;s hot path”.</p>

<p>Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day&#39;s action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain&#39;s blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that &quot;I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but &quot;gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. </p>

<p>By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. </p>

<p>To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain&#39;s observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. </p>

<p>On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain&#39;s many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water.&quot; General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that &quot;His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life &quot; </p>

<p>Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. </p>

<p>The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. </p>

<p>The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain&#39;s dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  </p>

<p>Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. </p>

<p>Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.</p>

<p>As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain&#39;s death certificate is &quot;a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America&#39;s greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century</p>

<p>This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then <a href=""https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html"">sub-sequentially found</a></p>

Small town Mississippi, I&#39;m single mom. My daughter was brutally raped a few days ago. It is bad. It will have lifelong medical and psychological consequences. I know who did it. It was a son of probably the richest and most influental man in the area who is best friends with sheriff. I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I have rock solid evidence. Rape kit, witness statements, text messages. I&#39;m recording all phone calls with sheriffs office and his father and have some incriminating stuff (I think). I&#39;m pretty much sure that sheriff&#39;s office is trying to cover it up. They are stonewalling me and last time I called they basically threatened to arrest my daughter for making a false accusation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperate, I feel like not only we won&#39;t get justice, but also if I don&#39;t tread carefully it may also turn against my daugter. Our Sheriff&#39;s office is super shady and they are absolutely capable of acting on their threats.</p>

<p>Going public and getting community on our side is out of question. They are very popular family, his father employs half of the town. The rapist is a popular athlete. I&#39;m not exactly popular around here (liberal single mom in heavily religious red area and I don&#39;t participate much in the community). I&#39;m sure no one will believe us and/or there will be strong victim blaming going on. There are already some rumours going around and they&#39;re not exactly favorable to my daugher. We have already decided to move after everything settles and my daughter gets a little better.</p>

<p>Also I heard that going to media may be double edged sword, so I would like to avoid that for now. </p>

<p>So what can I do? Go to state police, FBI? I have no idea what to do. Will this be comlicated, do I need a lawyer? Or can I just make a report somewhere?</p>

Long time lurker, first post. </p>

<p>This was a little over a year ago, I had signed up for a cooking class at a local kitchen supply store I really liked, because I wanted to be a better cook for my boyfriend. Shit was expensive, like $60 per class session, and each session was an hour or two. I bet in the grand scheme that’s not that expensive for cooking classes, but you had to buy a whole block of classes, and it seemed like a lot to me. Also worth mentioning is that this store was in a small town outside the city, and the town had a reputation for ‘rich people attitude.’ </p>

<p>So, whenever I’m a student, I ask a bunch of questions. I like to understand the material fully, which served me well in college. Classmates always seemed to like it, since I ended up exposing information that wouldn’t have come out otherwise, and half the time they wondered the same thing but weren’t outspoken enough to ask. Never been a problem for me. </p>

<p>Well, the teach did not like this, it seemed to annoy her, especially when I’d ask why a certain way of doing something was best for a certain task. I wasn’t challenging her, I was trying to understand the mechanics of cooking, but she got visibly annoyed every time. The fact that each question was echoed by at least a few other people in the class didn’t seem to matter to her, she was just there to tell us what to do. </p>

<p>The first class, she just looked annoyed but answered the questions. The second class, her voice took on an edge whenever she talked to me. By the third, she’d snap ‘just do it’ and half the time would straight pretend she hadn’t heard me say anything.</p>

<p>Well, at this point I’d had enough. I’m not paying through the nose to be ignored and snapped at. Time for consequences. </p>

<p>She was blond, pretty but not gorgeous, had some curves but not overweight, probably late thirties, and was definitely an amazing cook, bitchiness aside. And, most importantly, had no wedding ring. Hellooooooo thermal exhaust port. </p>

<p>So, as the class was rounding up and we were eating what we’d cooked, I commented (discreetly) to her how great her cooking was, and how her husband must be a very happy man. She shot me a glare while she said she wasn’t married. </p>

<p>“Oh I’m sorry, I just assumed you would be by now.”</p>

<p>The look of pure hate in that woman’s eyes will warm my soul until death takes me. She said nothing else, turned around, and made a beeline away from me. </p>

<p>The next day (the classes were weekly) I went in and spoke to the shop owner, letting him know that I was very unsatisfied with the class. I didn’t ask for a refund, since I knew he’d already paid for her to come teach, and didn’t want to burn him for what she was doing (it was a small shop and he was a good guy). I found out a couple months later that, while I was the first to complain, I wasn’t the last. She was not asked to come teach again. </p>

<p>TL;DR: rude bitch gets reminded why she’s single. </p>

<p>Also, to pre-empt the ‘there’s nothing wrong with being single’ comments, I agree there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s not about whether it’s ok to be single or not, it’s about how <em>she</em> felt about being single. And it was clearly a sore point for her, so she shouldn’t have been a bitch and insecure at the same time. </p>

<li><p><strong>Black Panther -</strong> Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I&#39;m not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It&#39;s also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn&#39;t enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let&#39;s note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn&#39;t even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther&#39;s release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Panther (cont.)-</strong> This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It&#39;s also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I&#39;m really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I&#39;m glad I could cover this weekend because it&#39;s one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film&#39;s existence just ten years ago. And now it&#39;s opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don&#39;t just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Man -</strong> Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don&#39;t think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace &amp; Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who&#39;s domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren&#39;t looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn&#39;t seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn&#39;t exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don&#39;t even like the animation style to begin with?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Samson -</strong> Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF&#39;s biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it&#39;s now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don&#39;t worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God&#39;s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God&#39;s Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oscar Movie Round-up -</strong> Not too much to report this week other than <strong>The Shape of Water</strong> managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M. </p></li>

With budget builds, it&#39;s super common to get 8GB memory, especially in a 1x8 config, thinking that you&#39;ll upgrade to 16GB later. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that if you plan to use the integrated graphics, your performance will drop <a href=""https://youtu.be/jm9baBI9LGg?t=576"">by as much as 25%</a> by using single-channel memory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say it again - get a motherboard with 4 slots. That way you can protect the 16GB memory path and go cheap on the 8GB of memory right now by getting 2x4GB. Additionally, unless you&#39;re going to be using an ITX board, you should be able to find a board with 4 memory slots for very little more money. </p>

<p>This goes for Intel units too - if you&#39;re planning on using the integrated graphics, you REALLY should do dual-channel memory. </p>
